Gomass
======

Gomass is an attempt to build a simple two players card based game, using HTML, Javascript, PHP and AJAX request.
This first commit is just a test which only allows you to :
- move cards on the board
- see the cards moving on another browser
- click "end turn" to let the other player move cards
- a reset button in case of bug
